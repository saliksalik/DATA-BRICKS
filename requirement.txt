"Document Lab 2: [Lab Name, e.g., Introduction to Databricks Workspace] in the repository.
 Create a README.md in the 02_[Lab Folder Name] directory
  with a step-by-step guide documenting the lab as if I'm doing it 
  – explain actions with output screenshots, keep it concise without long paragraphs. 
  Use the provided transcript/material: [Paste the full transcript or material here].

Then, check the outputs folder for images, list them,
 update the README to reference the actual image names (e.g., 'Image Name.png'),
  commit and push to GitHub. Ensure images display properly 
  on GitHub by using full GitHub URLs with ?raw=true if relative paths don't work.
   Handle any branch issues by pushing to both main and master branches, merging if necessary. 
   Address potential issues like missing images (note if any are absent), branch mismatches,
    and ensure the README renders images inline on GitHub."




    For Lab [Number, e.g., 2]: [Lab Name, e.g., Introduction to Databricks Workspace],
     check the outputs folder in the [Lab Folder, e.g., 02_Introduction_to_Databricks_Workspace]
     directory for image files. Update the README.md to reference the actual
      image names using full GitHub permalinks (URLs with ?raw=true) so they 
      display inline on the GitHub README. Commit the changes with a descriptive 
      message, push to both main and master branches (handling any merges or conflicts),
       and ensure the images are visible on the rendered README on GitHub
